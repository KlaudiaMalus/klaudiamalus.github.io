Zaglembe-Dobrowski in the Silesian Voivodeship, but after passing exams in high
school, I moved to Krakow. I changed my place of residence several times,
living, in particular, in Russia, the Netherlands, Scotland. I live and work
in Warsaw now. Frequent travel allowed me to meet and communicate with people
from different cultural backgrounds and different temperaments. Through this
experience, I have learned to understand people and their needs, which is very
useful when working with students. My native language is Polish, I am also
fluent in Russian and speak English at an upper-intermediate level.</p><h1 id=education>Education</h1><p>I am a graduate of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. I received a
bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Russian philology and then a master&rsquo;s degree in Russian
with a major in translation. In addition, I took a two-year pedagogical course
at Jagiellonian University. In 2020, I completed postgraduate studies in
teaching Polish as a foreign language. In March 2021, I took part in a training
course for examiners for Polish as a foreign language organized by the Medical
University of Warsaw.</p><h1 id=experience>Experience</h1><p>I have been teaching foreign languages since 2018. During my one-year stay in
Russia, I worked as a Polish language teacher in many language schools and
taught Polish at the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University. After returning
to Poland, I continued working in language schools in Krakow, Warsaw, and Lodz,
where I was teaching Russian and Polish. I taught Polish language classes for
refugees organized by the Office for Foreigners in Warsaw. Additionally, I have
been working in the examination committee for passing the state exam for a
certificate of knowledge of the Polish language since November 2021. Since 2022
I have been teaching Polish and Russian at public and private univeristies,
among them Wroclaw University of Technology and Polish-Japanese Academy of
Information Technology.</p><div class=pswp-gallery id=pictures><a href=/en/about/dyplom-jezyk-rosyjski-w-tlumaczeniach-specjalistycznych.jpg data-pswp-width=817 data-pswp-height=1146 target=_blank><img class=picture src=/en/about/_hu4a9a55f3b245dc9b64c54ce1248a7cf4_606624_eae0ac3aa4a464968795b767676f0620.jpg></a>
