I am Polish. I was born and raised in Zaglembe-Dobrowski in the Silesian Voivodeship, but after passing exams in high school, I moved to Krakow. I changed my place of residence several times, living, in particular, in Russia, the Netherlands, Scotland. I live and work in Warsaw now. Frequent travel allowed me to meet and communicate with people from different cultural backgrounds and different temperaments.</description></item><item><title>Classes</title><link>https://kropkaszkola.pl/en/classes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kropkaszkola.pl/en/classes/</guid><description>My classes The most important thing for me in teaching is an easy and relaxed atmosphere. I believe that learning a foreign language should be pleasant and valuable, which contributes to the achievement of good results. I often highlight that all people are different. Therefore I approach each student individually and try to adapt my methodology to the student&amp;rsquo;s predispositions. I have a lot of materials and linguistic games that I use in my classes, depending on the student&amp;rsquo;s temperament, skills, and level of language proficiency.</description></item><item><title>Translations</title><link>https://kropkaszkola.pl/en/translations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kropkaszkola.pl/en/translations/</guid><description>Translations I offer translations from Polish-Russian and Russian-Polish. I have experience in translating contracts and legal documents for small companies. I also worked with the Office for Foreigners in Warsaw where I translated educational materials for refugees. Additional, I specialize in creative translation of advertisements, i.e., transcreation, which consists in presenting a given message in a foreign language in such a way as to evoke in new addressees the same emotions as in the case of the original message.</description></item></channel></rss>
